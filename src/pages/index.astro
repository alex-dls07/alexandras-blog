  <p>  It is Apolloâ€™s birthday today! For some context, Apollo is my dog, and he is turning 4 years old today. For his birthday, we took him on a walk to his favorite park, bought him a cute birthday hat, and made him a steak, carrots, and peas dinner. He loved it so much, but he almost started choking because he swallowed a piece of the steak whole without chewing. I was a bit worried for him, but the birthday boy was okay!
